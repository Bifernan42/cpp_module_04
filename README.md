# Fifth C++ Assignment  

## Concepts: [Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Interfaces, Deep Copying]  

In this fifth assignment, we had to:  
- Implement **subtype polymorphism** by creating an `Animal` class and derived classes like `Dog` and `Cat`  
- Introduce **dynamic memory allocation** with a `Brain` class and ensure **deep copies** of objects  
- Convert the `Animal` class into an **abstract class** to prevent instantiation  
- Implement an **interface-like structure** using pure virtual functions (`AMateria`, `ICharacter`, `IMateriaSource`)  
- Manage a **Materia system** with inventory and cloning capabilities while preventing **memory leaks**  

This assignment reinforced **OOP principles**, particularly **polymorphism, abstract classes, and deep copying**.
